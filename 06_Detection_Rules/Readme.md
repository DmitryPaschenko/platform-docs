2. Navigate to Add  > Rule.

 3. Specify the information for the rule and click add rule. 
 
 PolyLogyx provides a seeded repository of rules in Sigma format that you can use as a starting point. These rules have been developed based on MITRE attack vector framework. These rules are available here: https://github.com/polylogyx/DetectionRules
