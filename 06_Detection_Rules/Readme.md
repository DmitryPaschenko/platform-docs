Understanding Rules
===============
Rules, in the PolyLogyx framework, offer a mechanism to detect malicious files and network connections.  

You can define rules using the web interface. 

Perform these steps to view or edit rules:
1. Access the web interface for the server.
2. Navigate to Soc Operations  > Rule.

  The Rules page is displayed. PolyLogyx provides a seeded repository of rules in Sigma format that you can use as a starting point. These rules have been developed based on MITRE attack vector framework. Navigate to https://github.com/polylogyx/DetectionRules to review the seeded rules.
3. Select a rule in the list to review its details in the right pane.  
4. Click Edit Rule (![edit_rule](https://github.com/preetpoly/test/blob/pooja/edit_rule.png)) for a rule to modify it. Click Update when done.
5. Click Add Rule to open the Add Rule page to define a new rule. Click Add when done.
