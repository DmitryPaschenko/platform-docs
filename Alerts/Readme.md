Managing Alerts
=================================== 

An alert indicates an important occurrence in the enterprise. An alert is generated when incoming event data matches a predefined rule or when event data (for last 24 hours) matches the Threat Intel feed. 
The Alerts page is the central console that allows you to manage and review alerts.  Click SOC Operations | Alerts to view the Alerts page.

Review Event Traffic
--------------------
On the Alerts page, review the event timeline for your enterprise on the top bar to review the traffic trend. Each cluster on the timeline represents a collection of events. Hover over a cluster to see its details. Click the + button to zoom in and â€“ button to zoom out. Use the arrow buttons to navigate the timeline. HOVER IS MISLEADING

Review Alerts 
--------------------
Click the AlientVault OTX, IBM X-Force, Rule, and VirusTotal tabs on the page to review the alerts based on the source generating the alerts. For example, when you click the Rule tab only the alerts generated based on predefined rules matching event data are displayed. 
Perform these steps to review alert information:
1.	Click the node name to view endpoint details. 
    When you click a node, the recent activity page is displayed where you can run various queries to view node-specific information. 
2.	Review the severity information.
    For rule-based alerts severity values are none, info, warning, and critical. For alerts based on the Threat Intel data, severity values are low, medium, and high. 
3.	Click Intel Data for an alert to view the source data based on which the alert was generated. 
4.	Click Alerted Entry for an alert to view the event associated with the alert.
5.	Optionally, use the Search field to filter alerts based on a criteria. NEED SPECIFICS
