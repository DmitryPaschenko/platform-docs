Managing Alerts
=================================== 
An alert indicates an important occurrence in the enterprise. An alert is generated when incoming event data matches a predefined rule or when event data (for last 24 hours) matches the Threat Intel feed. 
The Alerts page is the central console that allows you to manage and review alerts.  Click SOC Operations | Alerts to view the Alerts page.
